Algorithms from codefights website challenges. Most of them are following the rule of writing the code as short as possible - one of condition of the challenge. This is reason, why the code is not following any standards of clean code. Another requirement is to lead the algorithm to finish in strictly low computational complexity, which is forcing to bring the most efficient solution.
