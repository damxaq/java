You are given a string s, which consists only of lowercase English letters, and an array of numbers, nums. For each ni = nums[i], increment every nith letter in the given string - i.e. the letters with indices s[ni], s[2 · ni], s[3 · ni] and so on (1-based). For letters, incrementing means changing the letter to the next one in the alphabet. For example, a becomes b, b becomes c, and z cycles to a.

Example

For s = "abc" and nums = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
incrementCipher(s, nums) = "bde".

First, we should increment every 1st letter, so we just increment every letter and get s = "bcd". Then we increment every 2nd letter and get s = "bdd" (since the length of s is 3, there is only one such letter). And then, after incrementing every 3rd letter, we get the answer: s = "bde".
